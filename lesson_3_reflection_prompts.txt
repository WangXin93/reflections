When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    I can use remote repository between different computers, and share with other people with URL, and other people can help me to debug my code.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Manually push local git can help me to push stable version to GitHub, and have new developing version locally without break local code while developing.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks can fork GitHub repository to my GitHub, it will record who contribute to the code. Clones can clone remote repository to local machine, and branches can make various version of master, and maintain the stable version.
    So, I can fork GitHub repository between remote, clone it to my machine, and use branch to make my special version locally, and syncing it to my fork version.
    Remote GitHub is just like a remote branch.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
