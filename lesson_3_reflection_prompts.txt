When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    I can use remote repository between different computers, and share with other people with URL, and other people can help me to debug my code.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Manually push local git can help me to push stable version to GitHub, and have new developing version locally without break local code while developing.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks can fork GitHub repository to my GitHub, it will record who contribute to the code. Clones can clone remote repository to local machine, and branches can make various version of master, and maintain the stable version.
    So, I can fork GitHub repository between remote, clone it to my machine, and use branch to make my special version locally, and syncing it to my fork version.
    Remote GitHub is just like a remote branch.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    I don’t know yet. Maybe it help me to be able to  merge local master to origin locally offline, and push it when I am online.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    I don’t know yet. I think it must share file firstly, and need a communication tool.
I guess we can use local area network. 

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    When I want to develop a independent function or I want to maintain the master stable version, I will choose to work on separate branch, until I make sure the branch can work better while merging master branch.
    Work on master can avoid merging conflict though. When I finish branch work, I could encounter problems to merging master branch, but directly work on master branch can keep me on the top of master, without worry changes happened on master when I develop new things.
